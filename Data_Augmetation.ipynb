A helpful first step is to be able to generate a bunch of examples of what that looks like, so we can then learn the relationships between the original text, rewrite prompt and rewritten text.\n\nTo generate examples, we'll need a few things:\n1. A corpus of original texts\n2. A set of rewrite prompts\n3.

You can see exactly how Gemma 7B compares to to Gemma 2B [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemma).\n- Instruction Tuned: instruction tuning is an extra training step that results in a model that\n    can follow user instructions better. Our rewrite prompt is a kind of instruction, so this is what we want!\n- Quantized: quantization is a way of shrinking the size of a model by reducing the precision of each\n    parameter; so while our model still has 7 billion parameters, it's easier to run on limited\n    hardware.\n\nAt the end of this cell, we'll have a `model` we can call `generate` on with a specially formatted prompt.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -q -U immutabledict sentencepiece \n!git clone https://github.com/google/gemma_pytorch.git\n!mkdir /kaggle/working/gemma/\n!mv /kaggle/working/gemma_pytorch/gemma/* /kaggle/working/gemma/\n\nimport sys \nsys.path.append(\"/kaggle/working/gemma_pytorch/\") \nfrom gemma.config import GemmaConfig, get_config_for_7b, get_config_for_2b\nfrom gemma.model import GemmaForCausalLM\nfrom gemma.tokenizer import Tokenizer\nimport contextlib\nimport os\nimport torch\n\n# Load the model\nVARIANT = \"7b-it-quant\" \nMACHINE_TYPE = \"cuda\" \nweights_dir = '/kaggle/input/gemma/pytorch/7b-it-quant/2' \n\n@contextlib.contextmanager\ndef _set_default_tensor_type(dtype: torch.dtype):\n  \"\"\"Sets the default torch dtype to the given dtype.\"\"\"\n  torch.set_default_dtype(dtype)\n  yield\n  torch.set_default_dtype(torch.float)\n\n# Model Config.\nmodel_config = get_config_for_2b() if \"2b\" in VARIANT else get_config_for_7b()\nmodel_config.tokenizer = os.path.join(weights_dir, \"tokenizer.model\")\nmodel_config.quant = \"quant\" in VARIANT\n\n# Model.\ndevice = torch.device(MACHINE_TYPE)\nwith _set_default_tensor_type(model_config.get_dtype()):\n  model = GemmaForCausalLM(model_config)\n  ckpt_path = os.path.join(weights_dir, f'gemma-{VARIANT}.ckpt')\n  model.load_weights(ckpt_path)\n  model = model.to(device).eval()\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-27T00:00:56.484113Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-27T00:00:56.485153Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-27T00:01:18.443456Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-27T00:00:56.485119Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-27T00:01:18.441835Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Now we can loop through our input texts, randomly select a rewrite prompt, and see Gemma in action:\n\nimport random\nrandom.seed(0)\n# This is the prompt format the model expects\nUSER_CHAT_TEMPLATE = \"<start_of_turn>user\\n{prompt}<end_of_turn>\\n<start_of_turn>model\\n\"\n\nrewrite_data = []\n\nfor original_text in original_texts:\n    rewrite_prompt = random.choice(rewrite_prompts)\n    prompt = f'{rewrite_prompt}\\n{original_text}'\n    rewritten_text = model.generate(\n        USER_CHAT_TEMPLATE.format(prompt=prompt),\n        device=device,\n        output_len=100,\n    )\n    rewrite_data.append({\n        'original_text': original_text,\n        'rewrite_prompt': rewrite_prompt,\n        'rewritten_text': rewritten_text,\n    })\n    ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-27T00:01:18.444352Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-27T00:01:18.444741Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-27T00:01:18.444566Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-27T00:01:18.444583Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let's turn our generated data into a dataframe, and spot check the first rewrite to see if it makes sense.\nrewrite_data_df = pd.DataFrame(rewrite_data)\nrewrite_data_df[:1].values","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-27T00:01:18.445724Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-27T00:01:18.446113Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-27T00:01:18.445891Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-27T00:01:18.445905Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Next Steps\n\nHuzzah! We have a dataset with original texts, rewrite prompts, and rewritten text. Here are a couple of suggestions of next steps you could take to generate a larger, more diverse dataset:\n1. Add more original text data sources; besides just using all of the forum messages (instead of just the first 5), Kaggle has tons of datasets that would make reasonable input text. Here are few random datasets you could use:\n    - The `Plot` column from the [Wikipedia Movie Plots dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots).\n    - The `text` column from the [Emotions dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/emotions).\n    - The `body_text` and `abstract` columns of the [Wikibooks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/wikibooks-dataset).\n    \n    Note that each of these may need different preprocessing; for example, Gemma has a context length of 8192 tokens, so if the text is long, you'll need to truncate it.\n2. Use gemma to generate original text.\n3. Expand the list of rewrite prompts. You can come up with them manually, or explore having Gemma write rewrite prompts.\n4. Play around with the generation of `rewritten_text`:\n   - How does changing `output_len` affect the length and quality of rewrites?\n   - Do rewrites with the 2B parameter model differ substantially from the 7B model?\n   - Can you use [few shot prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot) to get higher quality rewrites?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
